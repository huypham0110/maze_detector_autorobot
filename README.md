# maze_detector_autorobot

- 1 Arduino Uno
- 3 Ultra Sensor HC SR04 (Using NewPing library to read distance)
- 1 Module L298 to control 2 DC motor

This robot will be activated when the control robot approaches.
We use the right-follow method to reach and the PID algorithm is used to stabilize the robot's distance from the walls
